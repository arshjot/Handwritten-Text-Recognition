# Handwritten Text Recognition with TensorFlow
Code and model weights for English handwritten text recognition model trained on IAM Handwriting Database. 
It is more or less a TensorFlow port of [Joan Puigcerver's amazing work on HTR](https://github.com/jpuigcerver/Laia/tree/master/egs/iam).
This framework could also be used for building similar models using other datasets. 
Codes for 3 architectures, BLSTM, CRNN, and STN followed by CRNN, have been provided.

## Requirements
- [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) - for image processing
- [imgtxtenh](https://github.com/mauvilsa/imgtxtenh) - for image processing
- [TensorFlow v1.12.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - for deep learning
- [TF bindings for Baidu's WarpCTC](https://github.com/baidu-research/warp-ctc/tree/master/tensorflow_binding) - for faster (GPU-based) implementation of CTC loss function
- [OpenCV 3](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) - for image processing (not required for prediction)
- (Optional) [TF implementation of STN (Spatial Transformer Network)](https://github.com/kevinzakka/spatial-transformer-network) - 
required for CRNN-STN architecture

## Steps for predicting on new images
A pre-trained model with CRNN architecture (5 Conv2D blocks followed by 5 bidirectional LSTM layers, 
hyperparameters and architecture are same as used [here](https://github.com/jpuigcerver/Laia/tree/master/egs/iam)) has been provided. 
You can use the model to get predictions on new images by following the below steps:

1. Place the images of handwritten text in the `samples` folder
2. Download the model weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D97_MO_bOxfqxiJ8dtpbVX-xNzwQW0mY/view?usp=sharing), 
extract, and place it under the `experiments` directory.
Ensure that the below directory structure is followed:
    ```bash
    ├── experiments
    │   ├── CRNN_h128
    │   │   ├── best_model
    │   │   ├── checkpoint
    │   │   └── summary
    ```
3. Enter the `mains` directory and run:
    ```bash 
    python predict.py -c ../configs/config.json
    ```

## Steps for training model from scratch
1. Download the [IAM dataset](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database) (you'll need to register on the website)
and keep the lines partition in the `/data/IAM/` directory as shown below:
    ```bash
    ├── data
    │   ├── IAM
    │   │   ├── lines
    │   │   │   ├── a01-000u-00.png
    │   │   │   ├── a01-000u-01.png
    │   │   │   ├── .
    │   │   │   ├── .
    │   │   │   ├── .
    │   │   ├── lines.txt
    ```
2. If required, modify the `/configs/config.json` file to change model architecture , image height, etc.
3. From the `data` directory, run:
    ```bash
    python process_images.py -c ../configs/config.json
    ```
    This will pre-process the images (add borders, resize, remove skew, etc.) 
    using imgtxtenh and ImageMagick's convert.
4. From the `data` directory, run:
    ```bash
    python prepare_IAM.py -c ../configs/config.json
    ```
    This will:
     - process the ground-truth labels to remove spaces within words and collapse contractions
     - read each image and create TFRecords files for train, validation and test sets using Aachen's partition

5. Start model training by running the below command from the `mains` directory:
    ```bash
    python main.py -c ../configs/config.json
    ```
## Results
The error rates, achieved by the pre-trained model, on IAM validation and test sets are shown below:

| Set        | CER (%) |
|:-----------| -------:|
| Validation | 4.83    |
| Test       | 7.01    |

## Notes
- Please ensure the text is written in black on white background, similar to the images placed in the `samples` folder
- During training phase, character error rate (CER) is calculated only after every 10 steps; 
otherwise, training is slowed down due to TensorFlow's ctc_beam_search_decoder
- Option for bucketing images according to image width (to avoid extraneous image padding) 
has been provided and can be toggled using the config file
- Keeping images with a large width range together in a batch might produce slightly lower accuracy due to padding.
A workaround is to keep batch size as 1 during inference.
